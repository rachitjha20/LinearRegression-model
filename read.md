# Diabetes Linear Regression Model

## Overview

This project demonstrates a linear regression model using the diabetes dataset from `scikit-learn`. The goal is to predict diabetes disease progression based on a subset of features from the dataset.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (optional, for plotting)

You can install these libraries using `pip` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
